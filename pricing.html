            <p class="sub">*Please allow up to 24 hours for response if sent outside of our normal business hours. We will do our best to reply quickly, but you understand. Many of our tutors have day jobs and go to sleep at some point. But still feel free to go nuts! There is no wrong time to ask.</p>
            
            <p class="sub">**We won't do the work FOR you (wink, wink - but no, we do actually want you to learn), but we will solve similar problems, point out mistakes we see in your work, ask you questions, and help you get to an answer step-by-step.</p>
