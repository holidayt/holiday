            <p>Are you proficient in secondary school math?</p>
            <p>Are you proficient in college-level math?</p>

            <h2>Then we might have a job</h2>
            <h1>for YOU!</h1>
            <h2>Our hiring criteria is based on <br>(in order):</h2>
            <li>Demonstrated proficiency</li>
            <li>Adaptability</li>
            <li>Willingness to learn</li>

            <p>If you're really, really good in one area, but not so much in another, there's still a place for you - but you'll have more options to work if you shine in more than one area.</p>

            <p>Never finished your degree?</p> 
            <p>No problem!</p> 
            <p>We're creating a network of people from different walks of life who can help students NOW.</p>
            <p>The important thing is whether you can actually help others learn what you have learned.</p>
